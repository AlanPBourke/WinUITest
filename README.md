# WinUITest
This is the basics of a Windows desktop application using the following technologies:
- .NET 10
- Windows APP SDK
- Win UI
- Entity Framework Core (using SQLite)
- Windows Community Toolkit

It aims to provide a simple application where customers and product records can be maintained and orders entered against the customers using those products. In effect it's similar to the Microsoft 'Van Arsdel' examples. While those are great examples of best practices they contain a lot of scaffold code for UI effects and general 'prettiness' that obscures the basic principles of the components being used.
